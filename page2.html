    <br>
   <p>The Lake City Quiet Pills mystery started with the user <i>ReligionOfPeace</i> suddenly disappeared 
   <br>
   User <i> 2-6 </i>then posted new about Milo's, ReligionOfPeace's real name, death. 
   <br> <i> AngelTwo-Six </i>, an account created 7 years before <i>ReligionOfPeace</i>'s death was made public knowledge shortly after
   <br>The bio of the account reads, "Dispensing Lake City Quiet Pills to lousy bastards in need of
   <br>permanent rest since 1968". This then lead to a website that connected ReligionOfPeace and 2-6 because Milo used 
   <br>the website and 2-6 had personal, in real life relation to Milo. Internet sleuths have gathered that the term "Quiet Pills"
<br>refers to bullets, and the sleuths also said that it sounds like the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.
<br>A very interesting piece of this mystery is that discussions on Lake City Quiet Pills took place on the day that <i>Mahmoud al-Mabhoud</i>
<br> was assasinated. Researchers started to question whether or not Lake City Quiet Pills was a meeting place on the internet for hitmen. 
<br> That there in lies the mystery itself, is it an crazy coincidence, or is there some truth behind the speculation? </p>
