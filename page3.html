<body><h1>These are only brief entries </h1>
<br>
<p>This area around Glastenbery, Bennington, Shaftsberry and Somerset
    <br>,Vermont, is a hotspot for unexplained mysteries that occured through 1945 and 1950.
<br> Middie Rivers went missing first while hunting in Bickford Hollow. He was 74 and a highly skilled outdoorsman
<br>Middie was last seen walking away from camp. After he went missing, a search party commensed and the only thing found
<br> was his hankerchief, which was south of his last known location.


<br>James Tedford, who was a 68 year old WW1 vet who went missing on the 1st of December of 1949. He was traveling on a southbound bus
<br>The last sighting of Tedford was at a bus depot in Burlington around 6:15 pm. It is said that he just vanished into thin air while riding on the bus,
<br> as no one saw him leave the bus, and that there was no way he could've gotten off that bus without anyone spotting him.
<br>It was also said that he was mentally ill at the time of his disappearence, which points to his strange behavior before his disappearence.
<br> 
These are just two of the strange disappearences in the Bennington Triangle.   </p>
